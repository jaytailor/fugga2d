This is my 2d Unity game source code. 

# How to build 

Use unity hub to build it on any of unity version, Currently built on 2019.1.4f1 but should build for later version. You can build it on 
- andrdoid
- ios

**Important. This works for android only with gradle version 5.6.4 so download that and change it in preferences gradle version in unity 2019.4
more information is here - https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/android-11-build **

# How to play
To play there are four levels - easy, medium, hard, super hard. 

The goal is to burst balloons in given time and not to pop bombs. You get 3 lives in case you pop 3 balloons. you will win if your pop 60 balloons in given time. 
Level only changes the time within you can pop the balloon. 

You can also purchase some theme screen from shop section. You will need to watch ads to collect points and with those points you can select a background theme. 

I am using Unity Ads for my ads need at the moment. Enjoy the game!!!

PS - This is an experimental personal project game so please don't mind some subtle issues/bugs. ;-)
