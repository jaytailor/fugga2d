HOW TO USE
==========

0. Open Example Scene
1. ParentalGateMenu prefab must be placed on Scene as Child of Canvas
2. ParentalGateMenu GameObject is connected to the main script - "GameControl"
3. "GameControl" is attached to "$" GameObject, in which you can assign callbacks to "ADULT" actions
4. "ADULT" action can be done after the correct answer in ParentalGateMenu

=============
HOW TO EXPAND
=============

//Set callback in "GameControl" without the need to climb into the "ParentalGateControl" class

public void NewAdultActionWithParentalGate()
{
	parentalGateControl.Show((success) => 
		{
			if(success)
			{
				NewAdultAction();
			}
		});
}

private void NewAdultAction()
{
	print("OK - NewAdultAction() Function call from outside the ParentalGateControl class - OK");
}

=============
HOW TO MODIFY
=============

//Use script inspector for "ParentalGateControl" of "ParentalGateMenu" GameObject

public string taskDescription = "5 + 3 = ?";
public string correctAnswer = "8";
public string textFalseAnswer = "False! ";

//Use "AnswerRow" GameObjects in "ParentalGateMenu" GameObject to modify answers

 public string correctAnswer = "8"; is compared with TextComponent.text of "LblAnswer"
